# Werkfast

A CLI script that downloads my work emails, scrapes data with Nokogiri, formats filenames, and saves them to .odt files.

*Why did I write this tool?* I write SEO during the day, which gets very repetitive. Werkfast helps me werk faster!

+ Run with an argument, like 1, 7 or 19
+ ex. `ruby bin/run.rb 10`

  *Start making requests to the Gmail API with [this guide](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/ruby).
